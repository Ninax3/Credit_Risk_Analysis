# Credit Risk Analysis - A comparison of machine learning techiniques

## Overview 
The Lending Club, a lending company, has provided a credit card risk dataset to build training & testing datasets, to analyze and recommend a machine learning model to identify high-risk customers for credit risk. The following machine learning models/techniques are applied and evaluated:

1. **RandomOverSampler** algorithm *(resampling; oversample)*
2. **SMOTE** algorithm *(resampling; oversample)*
3. **ClusterCentroids** algorithm *(resampling; undersample)*
4. **SMOTEEN** algorithm *(resampling; combination of oversample and undersample)*
5. **BalancedRandomForestClassifier** *(ensemble; undersample bootstrap sample)*
6. **EasyEnsembleClassifier** *(ensemble; undersample with balance boosted learners)*

## Results
